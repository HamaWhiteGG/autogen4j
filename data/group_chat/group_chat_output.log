To find the latest paper about GPT-4 on arXiv, we can use the arXiv API. The API allows us to search for papers based on keywords. We will use the requests and feedparser libraries in Python to send a GET request to the API and parse the returned RSS feed.

Here is the Python code to do this:

```python
import requests
import feedparser

# Define the base URL for the arXiv API
base_url = 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?'

# Define the search parameters
search_params = 'search_query=all:gpt-4&start=0&max_results=1'

# Send a GET request to the arXiv API
response = requests.get(base_url + search_params)

# Parse the returned RSS feed
feed = feedparser.parse(response.content)

# Print the title and summary of the latest paper about GPT-4
for entry in feed.entries:
    print('Title: ', entry.title)
    print('Summary: ', entry.summary)
```

This code will print the title and summary of the latest paper about GPT-4 on arXiv.

After we have the paper, we can manually read it to find its potential applications in software. This step requires language skills and cannot be automated.

Please run the above Python code to find the latest paper about GPT-4 on arXiv.

Title:  Can LLMs like GPT-4 outperform traditional AI tools in dementia
  diagnosis? Maybe, but not today
Summary:  Recent investigations show that large language models (LLMs), specifically
GPT-4, not only have remarkable capabilities in common Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks but also exhibit human-level performance on various
professional and academic benchmarks. However, whether GPT-4 can be directly
used in practical applications and replace traditional artificial intelligence
(AI) tools in specialized domains requires further experimental validation. In
this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs such as GPT-4 to outperform
traditional AI tools in dementia diagnosis. Comprehensive comparisons between
GPT-4 and traditional AI tools are conducted to examine their diagnostic
accuracy in a clinical setting. Experimental results on two real clinical
datasets show that, although LLMs like GPT-4 demonstrate potential for future
advancements in dementia diagnosis, they currently do not surpass the
performance of traditional AI tools. The interpretability and faithfulness of
GPT-4 are also evaluated by comparison with real doctors. We discuss the
limitations of GPT-4 in its current state and propose future research
directions to enhance GPT-4 in dementia diagnosis.

Based on the paper titled "Can LLMs like GPT-4 outperform traditional AI tools in dementia diagnosis? Maybe, but not today", the potential applications of GPT-4 in software could be:

1. **Healthcare Software**: GPT-4 can be used in healthcare software to assist in diagnosing diseases such as dementia. It can analyze patient data and provide potential diagnoses based on patterns it identifies.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tools**: The paper mentions that GPT-4 has remarkable capabilities in NLP tasks. This could be applied in software that requires understanding, generating, or translating human language, such as chatbots, language translation software, and content generation tools.

3. **Educational Software**: The paper mentions that GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks. This suggests that GPT-4 could be used in educational software to provide tutoring in various subjects, generate practice questions, or even grade assignments.

4. **Data Analysis Software**: The paper discusses using GPT-4 to analyze clinical datasets. This suggests that GPT-4 could be used in data analysis software to identify patterns and make predictions based on large datasets.

5. **Interpretability Tools**: The paper evaluates the interpretability and faithfulness of GPT-4. This suggests that GPT-4 could be used in software that requires interpreting complex data or explaining AI decisions in a way that humans can understand.

It's important to note that while GPT-4 shows potential in these areas, the paper concludes that it currently does not surpass the performance of traditional AI tools, particularly in the context of dementia diagnosis. Therefore, further research and development would be needed to fully realize these potential applications.
