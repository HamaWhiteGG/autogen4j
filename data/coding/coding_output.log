What date is today? Compare the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

First, let's get the current date using Python.

```python
# python code
from datetime import date

# Get today's date
today = date.today()

print("Today's date:", today)
```

Next, we need to get the year-to-date (YTD) gain for META (Facebook) and TESLA. We can use the `yfinance` library in Python to get the stock prices.

Please install the library if you haven't done so by running `pip install yfinance` in your terminal.

Here is the Python code to get the YTD gain for META and TESLA.

```python
# python code
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime

# Get the current year
current_year = datetime.now().year

# Get the stock data for the current year
meta_data = yf.download('META', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=today)
tesla_data = yf.download('TSLA', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=today)

# Calculate the YTD gain
meta_ytd_gain = ((meta_data['Close'][-1] - meta_data['Close'][0]) / meta_data['Close'][0]) * 100
tesla_ytd_gain = ((tesla_data['Close'][-1] - tesla_data['Close'][0]) / tesla_data['Close'][0]) * 100

print(f'META YTD Gain: {meta_ytd_gain}%')
print(f'TESLA YTD Gain: {tesla_ytd_gain}%')
```

This code will print the YTD gain for META and TESLA in percentage. The gain is calculated as the percentage change in the closing price from the first trading day of the year to the most recent trading day.

I apologize for the oversight. The 'today' variable was defined in the first code block but not in the second one. Let's correct this by defining 'today' in the second code block as well. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# python code
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, date

# Get the current year and today's date
current_year = datetime.now().year
today = date.today()

# Get the stock data for the current year
meta_data = yf.download('META', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=today)
tesla_data = yf.download('TSLA', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=today)

# Calculate the YTD gain
meta_ytd_gain = ((meta_data['Close'][-1] - meta_data['Close'][0]) / meta_data['Close'][0]) * 100
tesla_ytd_gain = ((tesla_data['Close'][-1] - tesla_data['Close'][0]) / tesla_data['Close'][0]) * 100

print(f'META YTD Gain: {meta_ytd_gain}%')
print(f'TESLA YTD Gain: {tesla_ytd_gain}%')
```

This code will print the YTD gain for META and TESLA in percentage. The gain is calculated as the percentage change in the closing price from the first trading day of the year to the most recent trading day.

Great! The code executed successfully.

As of today (December 18, 2023), the year-to-date (YTD) gain for META (Facebook) is approximately 168.49%, and for TESLA, it's approximately 134.51%.

This means that if you had invested in these stocks at the beginning of the year, your investment in META would have increased by about 168.49%, and in TESLA, it would have increased by about 134.51%.

Please note that stock prices are subject to market fluctuations, and the values provided are based on the closing prices of the stocks on the most recent trading day.

Plot a chart of their stock price change YTD and save to stock_price_ytd.png.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

Sure, we can use the matplotlib library in Python to plot the chart. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running `pip install matplotlib` in your terminal.

Here is the Python code to plot the chart and save it to a file.

```python
# python code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Normalize the closing prices to start at 100
meta_data['Normalized'] = meta_data['Close'] / meta_data['Close'][0] * 100
tesla_data['Normalized'] = tesla_data['Close'] / tesla_data['Close'][0] * 100

# Create a new figure
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))

# Plot the normalized closing prices
plt.plot(meta_data['Normalized'], label='META')
plt.plot(tesla_data['Normalized'], label='TESLA')

# Add title and labels
plt.title('Year-to-Date Stock Price Change for META and TESLA')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Normalized Closing Price')

# Add a legend
plt.legend()

# Save the figure
plt.savefig('stock_price_ytd.png')
```

This code will create a line chart showing the normalized closing prices for META and TESLA from the beginning of the current year to today. The prices are normalized to start at 100 on the first trading day of the year, which allows us to easily compare the price changes over time. The chart is then saved to a file named 'stock_price_ytd.png'.
